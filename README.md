**Introduction **
Project Overview 
A marker based Augmented Reality (AR) application under the theme of Space Exploration is 
presented in this project. Five different image markers, each representing a cosmic object or 
character: an alien, an alien spaceship, the sun, the International Space Station (ISS), and an 
astronaut have utilized in this system. By identifying these markers, the AR system renders 3D 
models in the real world seamlessly. Addition to visualizing space- related elements, the AR 
application endeavor to contribute an interactive and captivating learning experience through 
innovative features like sound effects, motion animations and practical systems 

Project Objective 
Designing and Implementing an AR application which detects image markers and overlays 
appropriate 3D model is the ultimate objective of this project. Each member of the team contributes 
with a unique space-related 3D model object. On purpose of improving the quality, artistic 
elements have been included. The decision to use Space exploration theme gave the opportunity 
to work with innovative interesting 3D models that provide both educational and entertainment 
value.
